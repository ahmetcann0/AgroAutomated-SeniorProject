### AgroAutomated-SeniorProject

The AgroAutomated project is an advanced solution for automatic irrigation and soil recommendation. It leverages sensor data for monitoring soil and weather conditions. The data is transmitted to a Java Web Server hosted on Google Cloud, where it is processed and stored in Firebase Database and Firebase Storage. A Flutter mobile app provides real-time updates to users and offers AI-driven recommendations for soil management.
